# **Concept 1 — Assignment 3: Scope and Quality Bar**

- **Task:** Summarize **1–2 academic sources** on **variable names**. Write in **LaTeX**. Add an **approach** section about process and Gen-AI use. Length: **2–3 pp** for 1 source, **4–5 pp** for 2 sources, **≤5 pp** total. Deadline **Fri 3 Oct, 20:00**.
- **Content must answer:** programming language studied; study type (code analysis vs preference elicitation); most important outcomes. **Integrate and compare** if using two papers.
- **Language/structure:** formal style, no errors, complete sentences, clear section headings. **In-text** citations + **reference list**. Use the **provided LaTeX template**. Include your approach at the end.

**Implications for scoring**

- Depth over breadth: fully summarize each source before comparing.
- Alignment: keep the text strictly on **variable-name research**.
- Transparency: declare any Gen-AI assistance; no copy-pasting.

**Suggested report skeleton**

- **Title + Abstract (optional)**
- **1. Introduction** — scope, definition of “variable name” in context, why it matters.
- **2. Methods of Source A** — language, participants or corpus, measures.
- **3. Findings of Source A**
- **4. (If applicable) Methods of Source B**
- **5. (If applicable) Findings of Source B**
- **6. Comparison** — converge/diverge on outcomes; methodological contrasts.
- **7. Limits and External Validity** — population, tasks, languages.
- **8. Implications for CS Education / SE Practice**
- **9. Conclusion**
- **References** — consistent style.
- **Appendix: Approach** — process + Gen-AI disclosure.

# **Concept 2 — Exam: Critical Essay on Gen-AI in CS-Ed**

- **Format:** In-class essay that **critically reflects** on **one** provided study. Notes may be taken now but **not** brought to the exam. Follow prompts. Write step by step.

**Preparation pipeline**

1. Select paper now. 2) Read twice. 3) Build a one-page mental map (no physical notes allowed in exam). 4) Rehearse a **thesis-antithesis-synthesis** outline.

**On the day**

- Re-read the paper, extract claim → evidence → limitation chains.
- Draft fast: **Intro (claim)** → **Body 1–3 (evidence + method limits)** → **Counterpoints** → **Conclusion (warranted scope)**.

# **Concept 3 — Audience and Genre**

**Communication goal ↔ audience knowledge dictates register.** Goals: inform, convince, entertain. Audience factors affect both **what** and **how** you say it.

**Genre features**

| **Genre** | **Typical cues** | **Use in course** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blog | rhetorical questions, personal voice | Not for Assignment 3 |
| Newspaper | concise, accessible, claims with light evidence | Not sufficient rigor |
| Novel | narrative, figurative language | Out of scope |
| Academic paper | precise claims, methods, citations | Target register |

# **Concept 4 — Academic Style: Five Constraints**

1. **Precise and critical** — specify actor s, time spans, measures. Replace vague tokens (“people,” “this thing”) with exact referents and intervals.
2. **Objective/neutral** — argue from evidence and reasoning, not assertion.
3. **Formal** — no colloquialisms; explicit reasoning; variables and controls named.
4. **Concise** — remove redundancy; keep only signal.
5. **Sentence discipline** — complete sentences; vary length; avoid fragments.

**Rewrite patterns (from slides)**

- Vague → “Researchers have studied **X** for **≥10 years**.”
- Unsupported → “It can be **demonstrated** via **Y** with references.”
- Informal → “Researchers **cannot yet determine** effectiveness; they will **analyze** data controlling for **age, gender, SES**.”
- Wordy → “Injury and mortality rates were **among the highest** recorded.”

**Quick checklist**: precise, neutral, formal, concise, not overly complex.

---

# **Concept 5 — Evidence, Referencing, and Claims**

- **Two supports:** 1) sources, 2) sound reasoning. Use a citation style (APA/MLA/IEEE).
- **In-text vs references:** cite when paraphrasing or quoting; provide full entry in the bibliography. Example on slides uses **Shafak [1]**.
- **Quotations:** rare. Once or twice per report or not at all. Never quote lists or long blocks.

**Paraphrasing algorithm**

1. Reread. 2) Hide. 3) Write anew. 4) Check: semantic fidelity, new structure, no sentence copying, no synonym swap. Add metacognitive checks: “Do I understand this?” “Am I thinking or copying?”

**Paraphrase example standard**

- Slide shows an **incorrect** near-synonym rewrite vs a **correct** conceptual restatement with citation (Thompson, 2009). Aim for the latter.

---

# **Concept 6 — Integrity, Plagiarism, and Gen-AI**

**Plagiarism (LU):** presenting others’ text, ideas, images, **code**, etc., as your own, **intentional or not**. LIACS: no copying from students or external sources; quote and cite if you must; **Gen-AI use is by default not allowed** unless a course explicitly permits it. Suspicions go to the **Board of Examiners**.

**Examples from slides**

- **Jesse:** quote present but only in bibliography → **plagiarism**; needs in-text and quotation marks.
- **Maja:** indirect source (Goodreads) → attribution doubtful; fix sourcing.
- **Toby:** rewrites Wikipedia to beat a scanner → **still plagiarism**.
- **Alex:** copies ChatGPT text → **plagiarism**; output is not your narrative and tends to be vague.

**Gen-AI rules for this course**

- **Exam:** not allowed.
- **Assignment 3:** optional aid, but **no copying**, disclose use in approach section. You remain responsible for content.

**Avoid-plagiarism decision path**

- Did I **originate** the wording and structure? If not, **quote** or **paraphrase** + **cite**.
- Is any code reused? Add **code header** and reference per example.

---

# **Concept 7 — Citing and Reusing Code**

- **Reports:** <Author> (<Year>) <Title> (Version) [Source code]. <URL/Publisher>.
    
    Example on slide: “Smith, J. (2011). GraphicsDrawer source code (Version 2.0) [Source code]. http://…”.
    
- **In code:** place a header block above reused snippets with **Title, Author, Date, Version, Availability**.

---

# **Concept 8 — LaTeX and Overleaf: Workflow**

- **Why LaTeX:** focus on content; precise control; strong math/tables; bibliographies.
- **How:** write .tex, compile via **TeX engine** to PDF. Use **Overleaf**. Leiden EDU link and quick tutorial are on the slides. Template on **Brightspace**.

**Minimal structure**

```
\documentclass{article}
% packages per template
\begin{document}
\title{...}\author{...}\date{}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}...\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
\section{Methods}
\section{Results}
\section{Discussion}
\bibliographystyle{...}
\bibliography{references}
\end{document}
```

(Use the provided template over improvisation.)

# **Concept 9 — Writing Process and Metacognition**

- Writing is **cognitively intensive**. Ideas and structure **emerge** during drafting. Use a **stepwise** approach and **metacognition**. Practice.
- Micro-effects matter: small wording choices change meaning. Treat writing as **craft**. No shortcut.

---

# **Concept 10 — How to Approach Assignment 3 (Operational)**

1. **Orient:** read brief + template; define scope.
2. **Find** an academic paper (or two) on **variable names**.
3. **Outline** the section headings first.
4. **Summarize**: methods → results → limits.
5. **Compare** if two sources: align research questions, methods, measures, outcomes.
6. **Revise** for style constraints and citation accuracy.
7. **Add Approach** section with Gen-AI disclosure.

---

# **High-leverage Do/Don’t (from slides, condensed)**

- **Do:** specify populations, tasks, languages, metrics. **Don’t:** use empty superlatives.
- **Do:** cite when paraphrasing. **Don’t:** synonym-swap.
- **Do:** quote sparingly. **Don’t:** quote lists or large blocks.
- **Do:** disclose Gen-AI use per assignment rules. **Don’t:** paste AI output.
