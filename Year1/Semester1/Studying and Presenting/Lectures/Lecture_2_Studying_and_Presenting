### **Lecture 2**

### **Assignment 2: Group Presentation on Team Roles**

- **Task:** Collaborate to create a group presentation on team roles, presented as a coherent story.
- **Deadline:** Friday, September 27th at 20:00.
- **Format:** A video presentation submitted as a YouTube link, WeTransfer file, or a direct video file.
- **Group Size:** 3-4 students.
- **Grading:** Every team member receives the same grade.
- **Team Role Test:** https://careerzone.universiteitleiden.nl/en/know-yourself/team-roles-test/

**Group Formation (Two Options):**

1. Form a group yourself.
2. Sign up for a general list, and the lecturer will place you in a group.

**Assignment Requirements**

- **Content:**
    - Discuss the outcomes of the team roles test for all group members, including the potential risks (e.g., what it means for group dynamics if multiple people have the same role).
    - Reflect on the team's functioning, discussing strong and weak points and offering solutions for improvement.
    - Discuss this reflection within the context of being a software engineering team, highlighting potential challenges or opportunities.
- **Delivery:**
    - Presenters should demonstrate appropriate pacing, use clear language, and connect with the audience.
- **Structure:**
    - The presentation must have a clear storyline with a coherent beginning and end, and smooth transitions between components.
- **Duration:**
    - The presentation must be 4-5 minutes long (no more than 30 seconds longer or shorter).
- **Supportive Tools:**
    - Use appropriate tools (e.g., slides, diagrams) that support the story.
    - Include an additional creative element that is original and enhances the story (e.g., a virtual background that reflects your team's identity).

### **Lecture Content: Collaboration**

### **What is Collaboration?**

- Collaboration is the continuous process of constructing and maintaining a shared concept of a problem.
- It implies that group members remain in touch, discuss progress, and share their understanding of the work throughout the process.
    - Shared determination of a goal/problem/solution.
    - Shared tracking of the goal/problem/solution.
- This is different from **Cooperation**, which involves dividing up the work and completing it individually.

### **Why is Collaboration Important?**

- **Cognitive Load:** Helps manage complex information by sharing it among team members.
- **Metacognition:** Develops "thinking about your own thinking" by making you more aware and actively involved in your learning.
- **Peer Support:** Team members can help and motivate one another.
- **Labor Market:** It is one of the most important traits for a software engineer.
- **Advantages:**
    - Share thinking processes, knowledge, and expertise.
    - Enables work on larger-scale projects.

### **Challenges of Collaboration**

- **Social Challenges:**
    - Different expectations.
    - Personal conflicts.
    - Concerns about criticism and achievement.
    - Unequal contribution from members.
- **Cognitive Challenges:**
    - Different opinions and ideas.
    - An individual's thinking process can be disrupted.

### **How to Collaborate Well**

1. Define Team Roles (Belbin Team Role Model)

A team role is a position in collaboration that reflects a person's preferences, qualities, and challenges. A balanced team is often the most efficient. This is based on Belbin's model of 9 roles across 3 types.

- **People-Oriented Roles:**
    - **Coordinator:** Good at delegating and seeing people's strengths. *Risk: May over-delegate.*
    - **Teamworker:** Keeps the team together and finds compromise. *Risk: Finds confrontation difficult.*
    - **Resource Investigator:** Expands the network and finds external contacts. *Risk: Initial enthusiasm may subside.*
- **Action-Oriented Roles:**
    - **Shaper:** Keeps the work focused and driven. *Risk: Can be impatient.*
    - **Implementer:** Develops strategies and turns plans into action. *Risk: May have difficulty diverging from the initial path.*
    - **Completer-Finisher:** Safeguards quality and details. *Risk: Can be a perfectionist.*
- **Thinking-Oriented Roles:**
    - **Plant:** Generates creative ideas and solves problems. *Risk: Can get stuck in a creative bubble.*
    - **Monitor Evaluator:** Is exact and makes logical decisions. *Risk: Can be overly critical.*
    - **Specialist:** Brings in deep knowledge and is driven by their field. *Risk: May have difficulty looking outside their specialty.*

**2. Create a Good Infrastructure**

- **Plan:** Develop a clear plan for the project.
- **Agreements/Rules:** Set team rules (e.g., requirements for a GitHub pull request).
- **Task Division:** Clearly divide tasks among team members.

**3. Hold Effective Team Meetings**

- **Goals:** Updating progress, making decisions, solving problems, and making new plans.

### **Common Obstacles in Collaboration**

Obstacles arise when the needs of any group member are not fulfilled.

- **Lack of contribution**
- **Differences in skill level**

**Potential Solutions:**

1. Address the problem directly with the team member.
2. Address the problem through infrastructure (e.g., clearer task division, rules).
3. Report the issue to the teacher.

### **Preparing and Delivering a Presentation**

- **Goal and Audience:** Always consider your presentation's goal (to inform, convince, entertain) and the audience's prior knowledge.
- **Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking):**
    - It's a common fear.
    - To manage nerves: prepare well, practice, find your style, and bring water.
- **Content and Storyline:**
    - Define your aim, audience, and format.
    - Structure the content with a logical start and end.
- **Supporting Materials:**
    - Visuals should support the story, not distract from it.
    - Keep slides clean, use informative titles, and use pictures (respecting copyright).
- **Connecting with the Audience:**
    - Use both verbal and non-verbal communication.
    - Be aware of common nervous habits (e.g., talking too fast, looking at slides instead of the audience).
    - Identify your personal habits (e.g., talking too softly, using overly complicated words).

### **Academic Integrity**

- **Fraud Includes:**
    - Plagiarism (all assignments are checked by Turnitin).
    - Cheating on exams.
    - Falsifying documents or experiments.
- Do not use tools like ChatGPT for your assignments.
