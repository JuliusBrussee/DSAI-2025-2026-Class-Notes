Synopsis: The course consists of 6 lectures focusing on study and academic skills, with assessments including 3 assignments and 1 exam. Key study strategies include spaced repetition and interleaving. Effective planning involves time management and prioritization using the Eisenhower Matrix. The first assignment requires a study diary documenting activities and strategies over a week, with personal reflections on their effectiveness.

# Lecture #1

## Course Overview

**Course Structure:**

6 lectures covering:

- Study skills
    - Effective approach to studies with methods like planning and note taking
    - Mostly evidence based
- Academic skills
    - Soft skills like writing, presenting, collaboration

## **Course Specifics**

**Assessment:**

3 assignments + 1 exam

1. Assignments:
    1. All 3 must be complete, 2 out of 3 completed with 6 or higher
    2. Average should be 5.5
2. Exam
    1. At least 5.5

**Final Grade:** 50/50 split between exam and assignments

**Deadlines:**

Assignment 1: Study diary - Friday 12/9 20.00

Assignment 2: Group presentation - Friday 19/9 20.00

Assignment 3: Writing - Friday 3/10 20.00

Exam: October 15 9.00

## Evidence-Based Study Strategies

**How Memory Works:**

Input (the stimuli)→ sensory memory → ((attention) working memory → (via encoding and retrieval you can rehearse) Long term memory) → Forgetting

**Key Processes:**

Metacognition: how we manage our own learning (thinking about your own thinking)

**Effective Study Tactics:**

Tactic 1: Spaced Repetition (more suitable for memorization)

- Repeat a topic or concept spread over time, opposed to massing, blocking, cramming

Tactic 2: Interleaving

- Interchange between different topics opposed to work on the same topic for a long time
- Combine with spaced repetition, work on topics ABC today and ABC tomorrow

Tactic 3: Active recall (more suitable for challenging problems, i.e. calculus)

- Test yourself and actively approach the material
- You can do this by reading and listening, with metacognition (orientation, monitoring, evaluate and repeat)
- Specific techniques: highlighting and taking notes
- Points towards gaps in knowledge/understanding
- Opposed to passive approach to text or information

Tactic 4:

- 

**Planning for Effective Study:**

Good planning requires time management, metacognition, realistic scheduling, breaks and other activities.

Steps for effective planning:

1. Overview of tasks
2. Eisenhower Matrix (prioritize)
    
    
    |  | Urgent | Not Urgent |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Important | Keep as empty as possible | Most tasks should be here |
    | Not Important | Spend as little time as possible | Set aside to do at a quiet time |
    |  |  |  |
3. Estimate and learn time per task

**Memory Exercise Example:**

Number to remember: 2311198724102012

Chunking strategy used: 2 3 triple 1 987 24 10 2012

### Skills:

**Avoiding Procrastination:**

*Don’t plan for the exam but plan to read through, make practice exams, and discuss questions*

- Planning and to do list
- Concrete and small tasks
- Know what to do
- Happy with what you did

**Advice for Taking Notes:**

- Write in your own words
- Prioritize listening and not writing (could personally definitely work on this)
- Identify cues for main point: title slides, emphasis, and repition through story
- Use a method (mapping, cornell, sentence note taking, charting method, feyman technique)

**Minimizing Cognitive Load:**

- Minimalize unneseccary stuff
- Focus working memory on relevant info
- Techniques:
    - Chunking
    - Diagrams, mindmaps etc
    - Worked-out examples
    - Collaborating

**Self Reflection**

- Self reflection with reflection sentences (when I did this x happened i noticed x, it could be improved, i wonder if it will work better with x)

**Communication with Teacher**

- Addressing a problem, asking questions, asking for help
- Finding for materials
- Always check guidelines specific course
    - Who is involved (TA, lecturer)
    - How to contact (email, question time, or office hours)

## **Assignment #1: Study Diary**

**Overview:**

- Plan your study activities and use of study strategies for one week
- Focus on the evidence-based strategies discussed in the lecture
- Keep track of your planned activities and study strategies during this week
- Pay attention to why you used which strategies and how well they worked for you
- Hand in your diary including your reflection as described below
- You can use any type of file and format you find suited for the diary. Make sure that the diary is clearly structured and written in appropriate formal language. The length should be between 2 – 4 pages.

**Requirements for the assignment**

The following components are included in the study diary:

- Study activities
    - Describe between 3 – 5 study activities
- Evidence based study strategies
    - Describe for each study activity which study strategy you used
    - Include in your diary in total at least 2 different evidence based study strategies
- Personal reflection on study strategies:
    - Answer the following 3 questions:
        1. Why did you choose your strategies?
        2. Which strategy did you prefer?
        3. Which strategies worked well and which did not, and why?
    - Add your own additional relevant considerations on your study strategies. For example, you can discuss if there is a strategy you currently don't use but would like to develop, or whether certain strategies fit better for certain topics.
- Appropriate structure and writing style
    - Use correct language and write in full sentences.
    - Structure your diary in such a way that the different components are distinguished clearly.
