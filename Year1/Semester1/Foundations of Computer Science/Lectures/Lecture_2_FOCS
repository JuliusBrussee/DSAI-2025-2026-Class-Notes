# **Set Theory II (Lecture 2, FoCS Fall 2025, Francesco Bariatti)**

## **1. Recap of Basics**

* **Sets**: defined by listing elements or describing them with a property.
  Example: ({0,2,4,…} = {x \mid x \geq 0, x \text{ even}}).
* **Membership**: (x \in A) means “x is in A.”
* **Universal set (U)**: the full domain we are considering.
* **Subset relation**: (A \subseteq B) ⇔ every element of A is in B.
* **Equality**: two sets equal if they have the same elements. Equivalent: (A = B \iff (A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq A)).

---

## **2. Set Operations**

* **Union**: (A \cup B) = everything in A or B.
* **Intersection**: (A \cap B) = everything in both A and B.
* **Complement**: (A^C) = everything not in A (relative to U).
* **Difference**: (A \setminus B) = everything in A but not in B.
* **Symmetric difference**: (A \oplus B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)).
* **Equivalent statements**:

  * (A \subseteq B \iff A \cap B = A \iff A \cup B = B).
  * Other equivalent forms use complements (e.g., (B^C \subseteq A^C)).

---

## **3. Proof Methods**

* **By diagram**: shading regions in Venn diagrams.
* **By elements**: unpacking definitions step by step.
* **By algebra**: using known rules of set algebra.

## **4. Algebra of Sets**

Analogous to arithmetic with + and ·.

* **Commutativity**: order doesn’t matter.
  (A \cup B = B \cup A), (A \cap B = B \cap A).
* **Associativity**: grouping doesn’t matter.
  ((A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)).
* **Idempotency**: repeating has no effect.
  (A \cup A = A), (A \cap A = A).
* **Distributivity**:

  * (A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)).
  * (A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)).
* **Zero/Unit elements**:

  * (A \cup \emptyset = A), (A \cap U = A).
  * (A \cup U = U), (A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset).
* **Complements**:

  * (A \cup A^C = U), (A \cap A^C = \emptyset).
  * ((A^C)^C = A).
* **De Morgan’s laws**:

  * ((A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C).
  * ((A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C).
* **Absorption**: (A \cap (A \cup B) = A), (A \cup (A \cap B) = A).
* **Duality principle**: swap ∪ ↔ ∩, ∅ ↔ U to get another true identity.

---

## **5. Proof Examples**

* Symmetric difference:
  ((A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B) = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)).
* Absorption, Idempotency shown by rewriting with algebra rules.

## **6. Counting with Sets**

* **Inclusion-Exclusion principle**:

  * For two sets:
    (|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|).
    If disjoint, (|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|).
  * For three sets:
    (|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|).
* Used in examples like counting cubes visible on a cube’s surface.

---

## **7. Sets of Sets**

* A set can itself be an element of another set.
  Example: ({1,2} \in {{7},{1,2},{7,12,5}}).
* Must distinguish between membership and being a subset.

---

## **8. Power Sets**

* **Definition**: (P(A) = {X \mid X \subseteq A}).
* Always contains ∅ and A.
* Size: (|P(A)| = 2^{|A|}).
* Example: (P({1,2,3,4})) has 16 elements.

---

## **9. Partitions**

* **Definition**: A partition of S is a collection of disjoint, nonempty subsets that together cover S.
* Example: Residue classes modulo 7 partition (\mathbb{Z}).
* Partitions can also be infinite (e.g., splitting naturals into multiples of powers of 2).

---

## **10. Lecture Focus**

* Development of **set algebra** (laws and proofs).
* **Counting principles** (inclusion-exclusion).
* **Sets of sets** (power sets, partitions).
