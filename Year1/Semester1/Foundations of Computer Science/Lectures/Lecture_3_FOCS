## **1. Sets of Sets**

- A set is an object, so it can itself appear inside another set.  

- Important distinction:
  - **Element of (∈)**: “is a member of.” Example: $2 \in \{1,2,3\}$.
  - **Subset of (⊆)**: “is contained inside.” Example: $\{2,3\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$.

**New concepts:**

- **Powerset of $S$**: The collection of all possible subsets of $S$.  
  Example: If $S = \{a,b\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(S) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}\}$.

  *Think of it as the “universe of all possible smaller groups” you can make from $S$.*

- **Partition of $S$**: A way of splitting $S$ into disjoint, non-empty pieces that together cover $S$.  
  Example: $\{\{1,4\}, \{2\}, \{3,5,6\}\}$ is a partition of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.

  *Think: dividing a set into separate “boxes” that don’t overlap, but together contain everything.*

## **2. Power Set**

- **Definition**: $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{X \mid X \subseteq A\}$.  
  In words: “the set of all subsets of $A$.”

- **Key facts:**
  - $\emptyset \in \mathcal{P}(A)$ because the empty set is always a subset.
  - $A \in \mathcal{P}(A)$ because every set is a subset of itself.

- Example: For $\{1,2,3,4\}$, the power set has 16 subsets (grouped by size).

- **Rule:** If a set has $n$ elements, its power set has $2^n$ subsets.  
  *Why? Each element can either be “in” or “out” of a subset — 2 choices each.*

## **3. Partitions**

- **Definition**: A partition is a collection $\{A_1, \dots, A_n\}$ such that:
  1. No subset is empty.
  2. Subsets don’t overlap.
  3. Together they cover the whole set.  
     *Think of dividing a class into groups where every student is in exactly one group.*

- **Trivial partitions**:
  - Everything together: $\{S\}$.
  - One element separated: $\{\{x\}, S \setminus \{x\}\}$.

- **Example**: Residue classes mod 3:
  - $[0] = \{0,3,6,\dots\}$, $[1] = \{1,4,7,\dots\}$, $[2] = \{2,5,8,\dots\}$.

  These three sets partition the natural numbers.

- Partitions can also be infinite: e.g., splitting numbers into sets of multiples of powers of 2.

## **4. Cartesian Products**

- **Pairs**: $(a,b)$ — groups two things in order.  
  *Different from sets: order matters, so $(3,7) \neq (7,3)$.*

- **Cartesian product**: $A \times B = \{(x,y) \mid x \in A, y \in B\}$.  
  *The set of all possible pairings of one element from $A$ with one from $B$.*

- **Examples:**
  - $A = \{1,3,5,7\},\ B = \{a,b,c\}$ produces 12 ordered pairs.
  - Infinite: $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ = all coordinate points with integer values.

- **n-tuples**: ordered lists $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$.  
  Example: coordinates in 3D space $(x,y,z)$.

- **Counting:**
  - $|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|$.
  - $|A^m| = |A|^m$.  
    *Think of “how many outfit combinations can I make” from different sets of clothes.*

## **5. Relations**

- **Definition**: A relation is a subset of a product.  
  Example: $R \subseteq A \times B$.
  - If $R \subseteq A \times A$, it relates elements within one set.
  - Notation: $(x,y) \in R \iff xRy$.

- **Intuition**: A relation is just a rule that pairs certain elements together.

**Examples:**
- People → Animals: $L = \{(\text{Alice}, \text{cats}), (\text{Alice}, \text{dogs}), (\text{Bob}, \text{dogs})\}$.
- Numbers: relations like “=”, “≤”, “<”.
- Sets: “subset of” or “disjoint from.”
- Ternary relation: e.g., $x+y=z$.

### **Counting relations**
- $|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|$.
- Each subset of $A \times B$ is a relation.
- So there are $2^{|A|\cdot |B|}$ possible relations.

## **6. Representations of Relations**

- Arrow diagrams: draw arrows between elements.
- Matrices: rows for $A$, columns for $B$, mark 1 if related.
- Directed graphs: if $R \subseteq A \times A$.
- Plots: if dealing with numbers like $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.

## **7. Special Relations**

- **Identity**: $\mathrm{id}_A = \{(x,x) \mid x \in A\}$.  
  Pairs each element with itself.

- **Inverse**: $R^{-1} = \{(y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R\}$.  
  Flips the direction of the relation.

**Important lemmas:**
- $(R^{-1})^{-1} = R$.
- $\operatorname{dom}(R^{-1}) = \operatorname{ran}(R)$.
- $\operatorname{ran}(R^{-1}) = \operatorname{dom}(R)$.
- $R$ injective $\iff R^{-1}$ functional.
- $R$ total $\iff R^{-1}$ surjective.

---

## **8. Domain and Range**

- **Domain (inputs):** $\operatorname{dom}(R) = \{x \in A \mid \exists y \in B: (x,y) \in R\}$.  
  All the elements that actually “send out arrows.”

- **Range (outputs):** $\operatorname{ran}(R) = \{y \in B \mid \exists x \in A: (x,y) \in R\}$.  
  All the elements that “receive arrows.”

---

## **9. Relation Properties**

- **Functional**: each $x$ connects to at most one $y$.  
  No person has two birthdays.

- **Total**: each $x$ connects to at least one $y$.  
  Every person has some birthday.

- **Injective (one-to-one)**: each $y$ comes from at most one $x$.  
  No two people share the same personal ID.

- **Surjective (onto)**: each $y$ has at least one $x$.  
  Every available seat has at least one ticket holder.

**A function** = total + functional relation.

# **Summary**

- **Powersets**: All possible subsets. Size grows as $2^n$.
- **Partitions**: Divide a set into disjoint, covering pieces.
- **Cartesian products**: Build ordered tuples. Size multiplies.
- **Relations**: Subsets of products, with many representations.
- **Key properties** (functional, total, injective, surjective) explain how relations behave. Functions are special relations that are both total and functional.
