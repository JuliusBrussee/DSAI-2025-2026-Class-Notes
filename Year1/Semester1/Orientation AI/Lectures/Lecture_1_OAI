# Orientation AI — Class 1: What is AI?

**Course:** Leiden University — Orientation AI

**Session:** Class 1

**Topic:** What is AI?

**Lecturer:** Max van Duijn

**Date:** September 2025

---

## 1) Social context: “What is AI?”

When people hear “AI,” they usually think about:

- Generative models (e.g., chatbots, image generators).
- Robots and autonomous vehicles.
- Concepts like singularity, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and ASI (Artificial Superintelligence).
- Ethical questions, privacy issues, and energy costs.
- Warfare and autonomous weapons.
- Societal influence of AI systems.
- Philosophical benchmarks like the **Turing Test**.
- Critiques such as the **Chinese Room Argument**.

---

## 2) Plan of the session

- Explore the history of AI.
- Examine AI in philosophy and popular culture.
- Ask what intelligence really is, human or artificial.
- Study and critique the **Turing Test**.

## 3) AI in the zeitgeist

- Current framing in media: “AI: hype or revolution?”
- Industry reports highlight AI’s momentum but also uncertainty.
- Important to remember: AI has **decades of history** in research and culture, not just recent hype.

### Cultural examples

- Theatre/performance piece *Uncanny Valley* (Ars Electronica, 2023).
- **Geminoid HI-1** (2004), an android robot created by Hiroshi Ishiguro, designed to look like himself.

---

## 4) Sentience and consciousness

**Questions often raised:**

- Is AI sentient?
- Is AI conscious?
- Can it think?

**Examples:**

- Blake Lemoine (2022) claimed Google’s **LaMDA** chatbot was “sentient.”
- AI Weirdness blog showed how large language models can generate absurd conversations (e.g., “interview with a squirrel”).

**Quote:**

> “The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.” — Edsger Dijkstra

## 5) Course practicalities

- **Exams:**
    - Closed-book multiple choice (~40 questions).
    - Final exam: January 14, 2026.
    - Retake: March 20, 2026.
    - Location: University Sports Center.
- **Question hour:** Held in the week before the exam.
- **Midterm homework test:**
    - ~10 multiple-choice questions.
    - Takes place during first 30 minutes of class on September 26, 2025.
- **Registration rules:**
    - First-year students are automatically registered for course and exam.
    - Other students must register via MyStudyMap.
    - Retake participants must also register separately.
- **Resources:** Course page on Brightspace and an online e-study guide.

## 6) Can machines think? The Turing Test

**Alan Turing, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950):**

- Reframed the question “Can machines think?” into a testable setup.
- **Imitation Game / Turing Test:**
    - A human interrogator asks written questions.
    - They must decide if the responder is a human or a machine.
    - Communication is text-only to remove appearance cues.

## 7) Approaches to AI (Russell & Norvig framework)

|  | Like a Human | Rational (Optimal) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Thinking** | Cognitive modeling | Laws of thought |
| **Acting** | Turing Test approach | Rational agent approach |

---

## 8) Dennett on the Turing Test

- Daniel Dennett, *Can Machines Think?* (1985).
- The test relies on the **quick-probe assumption**: if a system can handle unrestricted questioning, it must have many other cognitive abilities.
- Distinction between **restricted** Turing Tests (narrow domains) and **unrestricted** ones (any question).
- Risk of **“Potemkin Village” AI**: systems designed to fake understanding without real intelligence.

**Key quotations:**

- “Any computer that can regularly fool a discerning judge in this game would be intelligent—would be a computer that thinks—beyond any reasonable doubt.”
- “Nothing could possibly pass the Turing Test without being able to perform infinitely many other clearly intelligent actions.”

**Operational role:**

- The Turing Test avoids ontological debates (“truly intelligent”) by offering an empirical, behavioral standard.

## 9) AI dichotomies (continuums)

- Weak AI ↔ Strong AI.
- Narrow AI ↔ General AI.
- Symbolic AI ↔ Connectionist AI.
    
    (More detail to be covered in next class.)

## Connections

- Leads into **philosophy of mind** (consciousness, thought experiments).
- Sets up key benchmarks in AI evaluation (Turing Test vs. alternatives).
- Introduces distinctions (weak/strong, symbolic/connectionist) that will guide future lectures.
