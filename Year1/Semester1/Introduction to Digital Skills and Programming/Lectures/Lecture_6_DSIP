## Lecture 1 — Computational Thinking & the Programming Pipeline

### Slide 1 — Computational Thinking and the programming pipeline

**Idea:** How problems become running programs. From human description → formal steps → machine execution.

**Why it matters:** Exam questions trace a task through these stages or ask you to identify where an error lives (requirements vs algorithm vs implementation).

**Key terms:** computation, algorithm, specification, source code, syntax tree, compiler, interpreter.

**Key Takeaways**

- Separate *what* you want (problem/spec) from *how* you do it (algorithm) and *how* you tell the computer (program).

---

### Slide 2 — Learning goals

**Targets:**

- Turing Machine basics.
- Pipeline: problem → algorithm → (formal) specification → source → parse tree → compiled/interpreted execution.
- Syntax vs semantics.

**Key Takeaways**

- Map any exercise to the right stage; it reduces confusion and guides fixes.

---

### Slide 3 — What is computation?

**Plain definition:** Break a problem into small, unambiguous steps whose execution solves it.

**Context:** Algorithms have ancient roots; modern formalization leads to the Church–Turing thesis: what is effectively computable can be computed by a Turing Machine.

**Exam angle:** Recognize when a “step” is ambiguous. Ambiguity = not computable.

**Key Takeaways**

- Computation = sequence of precise operations. Precision beats cleverness.

---

### Slide 4 — The Turing machine (TM)

**Components:**

- Infinite **tape** (memory), finite **alphabet** (symbols), **head** (read/write + move L/R), finite **states** with a transition function.
- TM ≈ abstract von Neumann computer: tape ↔ memory, states ↔ control unit, head ↔ bus interface.

**Key Takeaways**

- Think “finite control + unbounded memory.”

---

### Slide 5 — TM task: outline a block of 1s

**Goal:** If tape has a run of `1`s, write `0` on both borders: `…1111… → …011110…`.

**Assumption:** Head starts on a `1` in the block.

**Key Takeaways**

- Always state assumptions: alphabet, start state, head position.

---

### Slide 6 — TM solution sketch

**Transitions (informal):** go left over `1`s to the left blank, write `0`, sweep right over `1`s to right blank, write `0`, accept.

**Mental model:**

```
state  symbol → (next_state, write, move)
goleft   1    → (goleft, 1,  <)
goleft   _    → (goright,0,  >)
goright  1    → (goright,1,  >)
goright  _    → (done,   0,  >)

```

**Key Takeaways**

- Trace one head move at a time. Never skip transitions when debugging.

---

### Slide 7 — Computational thinking: first three steps

1. **Well-defined problem** → 2) **Algorithm** (ordered steps) → 3) **Computations** (atomic operations: compare, move, set, jump, return).

**Pitfall:** Jumping to code before removing ambiguity in the problem.

**Key Takeaways**

- If you cannot list the atomic operations, your algorithm is not ready.

---

### Slide 8 — Programming: last three steps

1. **Program** (write code in a language) → 5) **Interpret/Compile** (parse + translate) → 6) **Execute** (run on CPU).

**Artifacts:** Source file → parse tree → bytecode/machine code.

**Key Takeaways**

- Syntax errors die at parse time; logic errors survive to run time.

---

### Slide 9 — Example problem: find index of a name in a list

**Problem:** Find the start index of `name` inside a character list/string, else `-1`.

**Assumptions:** Same alphabet, contiguous match, zero-based indexing.

**Key Takeaways**

- State data representation and indexing rules upfront.

---

### Slide 10 — Algorithmic steps (sketch)

- Initialize list index `i` and name index `j` to 0.
- Compare characters; on mismatch: `i++`, reset `j=0`.
- On match: store `start=i`, then advance `i++`, `j++`.
- If `j` reaches `len(name)`, return `start`.
- If `i` reaches `len(list)`, return `1`.

**Key Takeaways**

- Two pointers + reset on mismatch = classic substring scan.

---

### Slide 11 — Programming the algorithm

**From steps to code:** Translate each atomic action to language constructs (assignments, comparisons, loops, conditionals).

**Key Takeaways**

- Keep a 1–1 mapping from step to statement for first implementation; optimize later.

---

### Slide 12 — Compile and run

- **Compile/interpret:** Build a parse tree; check grammar; translate.
- **Execute:** CPU runs translated instructions.

**Key Takeaways**

- “It compiles” ≠ “It is correct.” Semantics can still be wrong.

---

### Slide 13 — Syntax vs Semantics

- **Syntax:** Form/structure. Example: `if (x) {}` is well-formed or not.
- **Semantics:** Meaning/behavior. Example: `if (x)` with `x` uninitialized may be syntactically valid but meaningless.

**Mnemonic:** **F**orm vs **F**unction → *Syntax = Form*, *Semantics = Function*.

**Key Takeaways**

- Exam traps often mix the two. Identify whether the issue is form or meaning.
