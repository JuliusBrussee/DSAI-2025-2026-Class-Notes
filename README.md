## Naming Conventions

- Directories: Title Case with spaces allowed (e.g., `Calculus 1`, `Orientation AI`). Avoid special characters beyond spaces, digits, and letters.
- Lecture files: `Lecture_<N>[_ShortTopic].md` (e.g., `Lecture_1_DSIP.md`, `Lecture_1&2_Calculus.md`). Use underscores instead of spaces within filenames.
- General course notes: `Notes.md` for miscellaneous notes not tied to a single lecture.
- Exam preparation: `ExamPrep.md` for summaries, key formulas, definitions, and practice checklists.

## Content Conventions (Markdown)

- Start each note with a top-level heading and, optionally, the date.
- Use the following sections when helpful:
  - Summary
  - Learning goals
  - Key concepts / Definitions
  - Worked examples / Exercises
  - References / Links
- Use fenced code blocks for code or pseudocode. Example:

  ```
  ```python
  def example():
      return 42
  ```
  ```

- For math, GitHub supports inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$` LaTeX. Keep formulas concise and readable.
- Images/diagrams: place under an `assets/` folder inside the course or lecture folder, and link with relative paths, e.g., `![Title](assets/filename.png)`.

## How to Add Content

### Add a new course

1. Create the course directory under the correct semester.
2. Add subfolders/files as needed:
   - `Lectures/`
   - `ExamPrep.md`
   - `Notes.md`
   - Optional: `Assignments/`, `assets/`

### Add a lecture note

1. Create a new file in the course‚Äôs `Lectures/` folder using the naming convention.
2. Start with a heading and brief summary; add learning goals and key concepts.
3. Commit with a clear message.

Template:

```
# Lecture <N>: <Topic>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
<2‚Äì4 lines>

## Learning goals
- ...
- ...

## Key concepts
- Term ‚Äî definition
- ...

## Commit Message Style

- Use concise, descriptive messages. Suggested pattern:
  - `Year1/<Course>: Lecture_<N> - <Topic> (<short summary>)`
  - `Year1/<Course>: update ExamPrep (sections + examples)`


## Roadmap / TODO

- Fill out currently empty `ExamPrep.md` files in `Year1/Semester1`.
- Prefer `.md` extensions for new lecture notes
- Add `Semester2` structure and placeholders when schedules are confirmed.
- Add assets (figures/diagrams) to each course as needed and fix any ‚Äúattachment:‚Äù style links by moving images into an `assets/` folder.

## Notion ‚Üí Repo ‚Üí Quiz workflow

You can import notes exported from Notion and auto‚Äëgenerate quizzes for each lecture.

- Quick import (manual export):
  1) In Notion, Export ‚Üí Markdown & CSV for the pages you want.
  2) Run the ingest script to place files into this repo structure:
     - Example: `python scripts/ingest_notion_export.py --source path/to/export.zip --default-year Year1 --default-semester Semester1`
     - Optional mapping: `--course-map scripts/config/course_map.example.yaml`
     - Dry run first: add `--dry-run`.

- Generate quizzes from notes:
  - `python scripts/generate_quizzes_from_md.py --root Year1 --out quizzes` (add `--force` to overwrite existing)
  - Heuristics supported:
    - Bullet definitions like `- Term: definition` produce multiple‚Äëchoice questions.
    - Q/A lines like `Q: ...` then `A: ...` produce short‚Äëtext questions.

- Auto on push (optional):
  - Workflow `.github/workflows/generate-quizzes.yml` runs the generator when you push changes under `Year*/` and commits resulting `quizzes/**/*.json`.

### Tips for better quiz generation
- Use clear definition bullets: `- Term: concise definition` or `- **Term**: definition`.
- Add explicit Q/A lines where you want guaranteed questions.
- Keep definitions under ~280 chars for cleaner options.

### Advanced (Notion API sync)
Prefer true sync from Notion? Add a Notion integration and use a custom fetch script with the Notion API (requires secrets like `NOTION_TOKEN`). This repo ships a simple manual‚Äëexport importer for reliability; happy to scaffold an API pull workflow on request.
