## Naming Conventions

- Directories: Title Case with spaces allowed (e.g., `Calculus 1`, `Orientation AI`). Avoid special characters beyond spaces, digits, and letters.
- Lecture files: `Lecture_<N>[_ShortTopic].md` (e.g., `Lecture_1_DSIP.md`, `Lecture_1&2_Calculus.md`). Use underscores instead of spaces within filenames.
- General course notes: `Notes.md` for miscellaneous notes not tied to a single lecture.
- Exam preparation: `ExamPrep.md` for summaries, key formulas, definitions, and practice checklists.

## Content Conventions (Markdown)

- Start each note with a top-level heading and, optionally, the date.
- Use the following sections when helpful:
  - Summary
  - Learning goals
  - Key concepts / Definitions
  - Worked examples / Exercises
  - References / Links
- Use fenced code blocks for code or pseudocode. Example:

  ```
  ```python
  def example():
      return 42
  ```
  ```

- For math, GitHub supports inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$` LaTeX. Keep formulas concise and readable.
- Images/diagrams: place under an `assets/` folder inside the course or lecture folder, and link with relative paths, e.g., `![Title](assets/filename.png)`.

## Add or Edit Quizzes

Quizzes live under a mirrored path of the lecture file in the `quizzes/` directory. The site automatically shows a ‚ÄúStart Quiz‚Äù banner on a lecture page if a matching quiz JSON exists.

- Location: `quizzes/<lecture path>.json` (lecture path without `.md`)
- Example: for `Year1/Semester1/Introduction to Digital Skills and Programming/Lectures/Lecture_1_DSIP`, add
  `quizzes/Year1/Semester1/Introduction to Digital Skills and Programming/Lectures/Lecture_1_DSIP.json`

Minimal JSON:

```
{
  "id": "y1s1-dsip-lecture-1",
  "lecturePath": "Year1/Semester1/Introduction to Digital Skills and Programming/Lectures/Lecture_1_DSIP",
  "title": "Lecture 1 ‚Äî ...",
  "settings": { "shuffleQuestions": true, "shuffleOptions": true, "showImmediateFeedback": true },
  "meta": { "version": 1, "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD", "author": "..." },
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "single",                      
      "prompt": "... (Markdown + MathJax)",
      "options": [ { "id": "a", "text": "...", "isCorrect": true } ],
      "explanation": "Why this is correct.",
      "tags": ["topic"], "difficulty": "easy", "points": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Finish behavior: the quiz shows Back/Next, and only on the last question a ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù button appears. Finishing clears in‚Äëprogress answers so a new attempt starts fresh.

## How to Add Content

   - Optional: `Assignments/`, `assets/`

### Add a lecture note

1. Create a new file in the course‚Äôs `Lectures/` folder using the naming convention.
2. Start with a heading and brief summary; add learning goals and key concepts.
3. Commit with a clear message.

Template:

```
# Lecture <N>: <Topic>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
<2‚Äì4 lines>

## Learning goals
- ...
- ...

## Key concepts
- Term ‚Äî definition
- ...

## Commit Message Style

- Use concise, descriptive messages. Suggested pattern:
  - `Year1/<Course>: Lecture_<N> - <Topic> (<short summary>)`
  - `Year1/<Course>: update ExamPrep (sections + examples)`
